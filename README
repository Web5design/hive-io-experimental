Hive Input/Output Library in Java.

The Hive project is built to be used through command line HQL and as such does
not have a good interface to connect to it through code directly. This project
adds support for input/output with Hive in code.

For started this means a Hadoop compatible Input/OutputFormat that can interact
with Hive tables.

In the future we will add other hooks for dealing with Hive.
